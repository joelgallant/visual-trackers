# visual-trackers
Meant as an archive for publicly released general purpose single object/target
trackers. Some are matlab, some are cpp. Links and papers all hopefully inside
the respective folders.

I am not the owner of all the projects. All credit goes to those authors - I am
only making this repository to keep them publicly available in an accessible
way.

### License
Trackers are individually licensed in their folders. All are under a
redistributable license.

### Structure
The `trackers` folder contains all trackers, some are cloned on a day, and some
are submodules (projects I figure will be maintained publicly).

If any of the submodule projects are publicly removed at any point, I will
try my best to get an archive copy and host it here.
