TLD: Tracking-Learning-Detection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLD is part of the [Visual Object Tracking Repository](https://github.com/gnebehay/VOTR),
which aims at providing a central repository for state-of-the-art tracking algorithms that are freely available.
The source code for this tracker was obtained from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zk00006/OpenTLD)
and extended by a challenge mode.
The following description was copied literally from the original author.

TLD 1.0 (Predator)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLD is an algorithm for tracking of unknown objects in unconstrained video streams. The object of interest is defined by a bounding box in a single frame. TLD simultaneously tracks the object, learns its appearance and detects it whenever it appears in the video.
