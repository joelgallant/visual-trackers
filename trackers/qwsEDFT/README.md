qwsDFT: Power Updated Weighted Comparison Enhanced Distribution Field Tracker
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

qwsDFT is part of the [Visual Object Tracking Repository](https://github.com/gnebehay/VOTR),
which aims at providing a central repository for state-of-the-art tracking algorithms that are freely available.
The source code for this tracker was submitted for the [VOT2014 challenge](https://www.votchallenge.net).
A minor adaption was made by using MATLAB's imresize() function
instead of a custom mex file to increase portability.
